#### **Inspiration**

In our state, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, students are brimming with untapped potential. Yet, they face a harsh reality: the digital divide and lack of exposure to technology rob them of opportunities to shine in today‚Äôs fast-paced, tech-driven world. These young minds, often the first in their families to dream of higher education, are held back by systemic challenges.  

Imagine a classroom where students are eager to learn, but they don‚Äôt have access to computers. Picture a teenager with incredible problem-solving skills who has never heard of coding. Visualize a community where dreams of a better future are stifled by the absence of mentors, guidance, and career clarity. This is the current state for many students in our rural and semi-urban regions.  

Despite their talent and determination, these students encounter:  
- **A lack of awareness** about opportunities in technology and beyond.  
- **Scarce resources**‚Äîfew computers, unreliable internet, and outdated learning materials.  
- **Limited mentorship**, leaving them directionless in choosing careers or developing skills.  
- **An education system** that prioritizes rote learning over hands-on experience, making it difficult to compete in a global job market.

### Challenges We Ran Into

1. **Model Size and Documentation**: One of the key challenges we faced was managing the large AI models, such as **LLaMA-2**, which significantly impacted performance and memory usage. Additionally, the complexity of model documentation made the integration process difficult and time-consuming, requiring careful handling and understanding to implement effectively.

2. **Integration and Optimization**: Running large models like **LLaMA-2** on devices with limited computing power and bandwidth posed another challenge. Optimizing these models for performance while maintaining functionality and user experience was crucial. We had to ensure that the platform remained responsive and efficient, even on lower-end devices.

3. **OCR-Based Doubt-Solving Tool**: Developing an accurate OCR system to read and solve problems from scanned or handwritten content was a complex task. Ensuring the OCR tool could handle varying handwriting styles and image quality while providing accurate, real-time solutions was a significant hurdle.

Despite these challenges, we successfully overcame each issue by optimizing models, refining the integration process, and ensuring the accuracy of our tools. This allowed us to deliver a seamless and functional learning experience for underprivileged students.
