## Browser Support
Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE 11

## Installation
### Install using your favorite package manager (yarn, npm)
```bash
npm install cloudinary-core
```
Or
```bash
yarn add cloudinary-core
```

## Usage
### Setup
There are several ways to configure cloudinary-core:

##### Explicitly
```javascript
var cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new( { cloud_name: "demo"});
```

##### Using the config function
```javascript

// Using the config function
var cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new();
cl.config( "cloud_name", "demo");
```

##### From meta tags in the current HTML document
When using the library in a browser environment, you can use meta tags to define the configuration options.

The `init()` function is a convenience function that invokes both `fromDocument()` and `fromEnvironment()`.


For example, add the following to the header tag:
```html
<meta name="cloudinary_cloud_name" content="demo">
```

In your JavaScript source, invoke `fromDocument()`:
```javascript
var cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new();
cl.fromDocument();
// or
cl.init();
```

##### From environment variables

When using the library in a backend environment such as NodeJS, you can use an environment variable to define the configuration options.

Set the environment variable, for example:
```shell
export CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://demo
```
In your JavaScript source, invoke `fromEnvironment()`:
```javascript
var cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new();
cl.fromEnvironment();
// or
cl.init();
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript1_image_manipulation)

```javascript
// Apply a single transformation
cl.url( "sample", { crop: "scale", width: "200", angle: "10" })

// Chain (compose) multiple transformations
cl.url( "sample", {
  transformation: [
    { angle: -45 },
    { effect: "trim", angle: "45", crop: "scale", width: "600" },
    { overlay: "text:Arial_100:Hello" }
  ]
});
```

### Generate Image and Video HTML Tags
- Use the ```image()``` function to generate an HTMLImageElement
- Use the ```imageTag()``` function to generate an ImageTag instance
- Use the ```video()``` function to generate an HTMLVideoElement
- Use the ```videoTag()``` function to generate a VideoTag instance

### File upload
