## About

Express 4.x `layout`, `partial` and `block` template functions for the EJS template engine.

Previously also offered `include` but you should use EJS 1.0.x's own directive for that now.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install ejs-mate --save
```

(`--save` automatically writes to your `package.json` file, tell your friends)

## Usage

Run `node app.js` from `examples` and open `localhost:3000` to see a working example.

Given a template, `index.ejs`:

```html
<% layout('boilerplate') -%>
<h1>I am the <%= what %> template</h1>
```

And a layout, `boilerplate.ejs`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>It's <%= who %></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <%- body -%>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

When rendered by an Express 4.0 app:

```js
var express = require('express'),
  engine = require('ejs-mate'),
  app = express();

// use ejs-locals for all ejs templates:
app.engine('ejs', engine);

app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); // so you can render('index')

// render 'index' into 'boilerplate':
app.get('/',function(req,res,next){
  res.render('index', { what: 'best', who: 'me' });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

You get the following result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>It's me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <h1>I am the best template</h1>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note, if you haven't seen it before, this example uses trailing dashes in the EJS includes to slurp trailing whitespace and generate cleaner HTML. It's not strictly necessary.

## Features

### `layout(view)`

When called anywhere inside a template, requests that the output of the current template be passed to the given view as the `body` local. Use this to specify layouts from within your template, which is recommended with Express 3.0, since the app-level layout functionality has been removed.

### `partial(name,optionsOrCollection)`

When called anywhere inside a template, adds the given view to that template using the current given `optionsOrCollection`. The usual way to use this is to pass an Array as the collection argument. The given view is then executed for each item in the Array; the item is passed into the view as a local with a name generated from the view's filename.

For example, if you do `<%-partial('thing',things)%>` then each item in the `things` Array is passed to `thing.ejs` with the name `thing`. If you rename the template, the local name of each item will correspond to the template name.

### `block('name')`

Calling `block('name')` creates the named block if it doesn't exist, and then returns an object with `append()`, `prepend()`, `replace()`, and `toString()`.

Basic usage:

body-template.ejs
```
<% layout('boilerplate') -%>
<% block('head').append('<link type="text/css" href="/foo.css">') %>
<h1>I am the template</h1>
<% block('footer').append('<script src="/bar.js"></script>') %>
```

And a layout, `boilerplate.ejs`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>I'm the layout</title>
    <%- block('head').toString() %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <%-body -%>
    </section>
    <%= block('footer').toString() %>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite first invoke the following command within the repo, installing the development dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install -d
```

then run the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```

## Whither Include?

We upgrade EJS to v3.x, it used as a method now:

```html
<%- include('path/view') %>
```

## Credits

This library is a fork from Robert Tom Carden's [ejs-locals](https://github.com/RandomEtc/ejs-locals), and the partial function remains relatively untouched from there (aside from cache support). Robert is still updating his library and it now supports other template engines - check it out!
