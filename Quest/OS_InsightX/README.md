
##   OS Insight X

This application allows users to interact with Galvin's Operating System textbook by asking questions and receiving accurate, context-aware answers. The system leverages LangChain for document processing and LLMWare for intelligent responses.

## Features

- Load and process PDF documents from Galvin's OS textbook.
- Split documents into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.
- Use pre-trained LLMWare models to generate embeddings and provide answers.
- Simple Streamlit interface for easy interaction.
