""" Fast Start Example #1 - Library - converting document files into an indexed knowledge collection.

    In this example, we will illustrate a basic recipe for completing the following steps:

      1. Create a library as an organizing construct for your knowledge-base
      2. Download sample files for a Fast Start - easy to 'swap out' and replace with your own files
      3. Use library.add_files method to automatically parse, text chunk and index the documents
      4. Run a basic text query against your new Library
