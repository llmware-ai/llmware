""" This example shows a complex multi-part research analysis.  In this example, we will:

    1.  Build a "research" library.
    2.  Query the research library to identify topics of interest.
    3.  Create an agent with several analytical tools: sentiment, emotions, topic, entities analysis
    4.  Pass the results of our query to the agent to conduct multifaceted analysis.
    5.  Apply a top-level filter ('sentiment') on the results from the query
    6.  For any of the passages with negative sentiment, we will run a follow-up set of analyses.
    7.  Finally, we will assemble the follow-up analysis into a list of detailed reports.
