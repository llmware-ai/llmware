"""The llmware package provides tools to build large language model (LLM) applications, this includes
a custom set of LLMs that are small and open source.

The llmware package aspires to be a middleware in LLM applications. In other words, it provides the
infrastructure between the components, such as the models, the prompts, the text databases, and
the vector databases.
