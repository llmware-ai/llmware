## üß∞üõ†Ô∏èüî©Building Enterprise RAG Pipelines with Small, Specialized Models  

`llmware` provides a unified framework for building LLM-based applications (e.g, RAG, Agents), using small, specialized models that can be deployed privately, integrated with enterprise knowledge sources safely and securely, and cost-effectively tuned and adapted for any business process.  

 `llmware` has two main components:  
 
 1.  **RAG Pipeline** - integrated components for the full lifecycle of connecting knowledge sources to generative AI models; and 

 2.  **50+ small, specialized models** fine-tuned for key tasks in enterprise process automation, including fact-based question-answering, classification, summarization, and extraction.  

By bringing together both of these components, along with integrating leading open source models and underlying technologies, `llmware` offers a comprehensive set of tools to rapidly build knowledge-based enterprise LLM applications.  

Most of our examples can be run without a GPU server - get started right away on your laptop.

## üéØ  Key features 
Writing code with`llmware` is based on a few main concepts:

<details>
<summary><b>Model Catalog</b>: Access all models the same way with easy lookup, regardless of the underlying implementation. 
</summary>  


```python
#   150+ Models in Catalog with 50+ RAG-optimized BLING, DRAGON and Industry BERT models
#   Full support for GGUF, HuggingFace, Sentence Transformers and major API-based models
#   Easy to extend to add custom models - see examples

from llmware.models import ModelCatalog
from llmware.prompts import Prompt

#   All models accessed through the ModelCatalog
models = ModelCatalog().list_all_models()

#   to use any model in the ModelCatalog - "load_model" method and pass the model_name parameter
my_model = ModelCatalog().load_model("llmware/bling-phi-3-gguf")
output = my_model.inference("what is the future of AI?", add_context="Here is the article to read")

#   to integrate the model into a Prompt
prompter = Prompt().load_model("llmware/bling-tiny-llama-v0")
response = prompter.prompt_main("what is the future of AI?", context="Insert Sources of information")
```

</details>  

<details>  
<summary><b>Library</b>:  ingest, organize, and index a collection of knowledge at scale - Parse, Text Chunk, and Embed. </summary>  

```python

from llmware.library import Library

#   to parse and text chunk a set of documents (pdf, pptx, docx, xlsx, txt, csv, md, json/jsonl, wav, png, jpg, html)  

#   step 1 - create a library, which is the 'knowledge-base container' construct
#          - libraries have both text collection (DB) resources, and file resources (e.g., llmware_data/accounts/{library_name})
#          - embeddings and queries are run against a library

lib = Library().create_new_library("my_library")

#    step 2 - add_files is the universal ingestion function - point it at a local file folder with mixed file types
#           - files will be routed by file extension to the correct parser, parsed, text chunked and indexed in text collection DB

lib.add_files("/folder/path/to/my/files")

#   To install an embedding on a library - pick an embedding model and vector_db
lib.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="mini-lm-sbert", vector_db="milvus", batch_size=500)

#   to add a second embedding to the same library (mix-and-match models + vector db)  
lib.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="industry-bert-sec", vector_db="chromadb", batch_size=100)

#   easy to create multiple libraries for different projects and groups

finance_lib = Library().create_new_library("finance_q4_2023")
finance_lib.add_files("/finance_folder/")

hr_lib = Library().create_new_library("hr_policies")
hr_lib.add_files("/hr_folder/")

#    pull library card with key metadata - documents, text chunks, images, tables, embedding record
lib_card = Library().get_library_card("my_library")

#   see all libraries
all_my_libs = Library().get_all_library_cards()

```
</details>  

<details> 
<summary><b>Query</b>: query libraries with a mix of text, semantic, hybrid, metadata, and custom filters. </summary>

```python

from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.library import Library

#   Step 1 - load the previously created library 
lib = Library().load_library("my_library")

#   Step 2 - create a query object and pass the library
q = Query(lib)

#    Step 3 - run lots of different queries  (many other options in the examples)

#    Basic text query
results1 = q.text_query("text query", result_count=20, exact_mode=False)

#    semantic query
results2 = q.semantic_query("semantic query", result_count=10)

#    Combining a text query restricted to only certain documents in the library and an "exact" match to the query
results3 = q.text_query_with_document_filter("new query", {"file_name": "selected file name"}, exact_mode=True)

#   to apply a specific embedding (if multiple on the library), pass the names when creating the query object
q2 = Query(lib, embedding_model_name="mini_lm_sbert", vector_db="milvus")
results4 = q2.semantic_query("new semantic query")
```

</details>  

<details>
<summary><b>Prompt with Sources</b>: the easiest way to combine knowledge retrieval with an LLM inference. </summary>

```python

from llmware.prompts import Prompt
from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.library import Library

#   build a prompt
prompter = Prompt().load_model("llmware/bling-tiny-llama-v0")

#   add a file -> file is parsed, text chunked, filtered by query, and then packaged as model-ready context,
#   including in batches, if needed, to fit the model context window

source = prompter.add_source_document("/folder/to/one/doc/", "filename", query="fast query")

#   attach query results (from a Query) into a Prompt
my_lib = Library().load_library("my_library")
results = Query(my_lib).query("my query")
source2 = prompter.add_source_query_results(results)

#   run a new query against a library and load directly into a prompt
source3 = prompter.add_source_new_query(my_lib, query="my new query", query_type="semantic", result_count=15)

#   to run an inference with 'prompt with sources'
responses = prompter.prompt_with_source("my query")

#   to run fact-checks - post inference
fact_check = prompter.evidence_check_sources(responses)

#   to view source materials (batched 'model-ready' and attached to prompt)
source_materials = prompter.review_sources_summary()

#   to see the full prompt history
prompt_history = prompter.get_current_history()

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working with the llmware Github repository  

The llmware repo can be pulled locally to get access to all the examples or to work directly with the latest version of the llmware code.  

```bash
git clone git@github.com:llmware-ai/llmware.git
```  

We have provided a **welcome_to_llmware** automation script in the root of the repository folder.  After cloning:  
- On Windows command line:  `.\welcome_to_llmware_windows.sh`  
- On Mac / Linux command line:  `sh ./welcome_to_llmware.sh`  

Alternatively, if you prefer to complete the setup without the welcome automation script, then the next steps include:  

1.  **install requirements.txt** - inside the /llmware path - e.g., ```pip3 install -r llmware/requirements.txt```  

2.  **install requirements_extras.txt** - inside the /llmware path - e.g., ```pip3 install -r llmware/requirements_extras.txt```  (Depending upon your use case, you may not need all or any of these installs, but some of these will be used in the examples.)  

3.  **Run examples** - copy one or more of the example .py files into the root project path.   (We have seen several IDEs that will attempt to run interactively from the nested /example path, and then not have access to the /llmware module - the easy fix is to just copy the example you want to run into the root path).  

4.  **install vector db** - no-install vector db options include Milvus lite, chromadb, faiss and lancedb - which do not require a server install, but do require that you install the python sdk library for that vector db, e.g., `pip3 install pymilvus`, or `pip3 install chromadb`.  If you look in [examples/Embedding](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/tree/main/examples/Embedding), you will see examples for getting started with various vector DB, and in the root of the repo, you will see easy-to-get-started docker-compose scripts for installing milvus, postgres/pgvector, mongo, qdrant, neo4j, and redis.  

5.  Pytorch 2.3 note:  we have seen recently issues with Pytorch==2.3 on some platforms - if you run into any issues, we have seen that uninstalling Pytorch and down leveling to Pytorch==2.1 usually solves the problem.  

6.  Numpy 2.0 note: we have seen issues with numpy 2.0 with many libraries not yet supporting.  Our pip install setup will accept numpy 2.0 (to avoid pip conflicts), but if you pull from the repo, we restrict it to <2.   If you run into issues with numpy, we have found that they can be fixed by downgrading numpy to <2, e.g., 1.26.4.  To use WhisperCPP, you should downlevel to numpy <2.

## Meet our Models   

- **SLIM model series:** small, specialized models fine-tuned for function calling and multi-step, multi-model Agent workflows.  
- **DRAGON model series:**  Production-grade RAG-optimized 6-9B parameter models - "Delivering RAG on ..." the leading foundation base models.  
- **BLING model series:**  Small CPU-based RAG-optimized, instruct-following 1B-5B parameter models.  
- **Industry BERT models:**  out-of-the-box custom-trained sentence transformer embedding models fine-tuned for the following industries:  Insurance, Contracts, Asset Management, SEC.  
- **GGUF Quantization:** We provide 'gguf' and 'tool' versions of many SLIM, DRAGON, and BLING models, optimized for CPU deployment.  

## Using LLMs and setting up API keys & secrets

LLMWare is an open platform and supports a wide range of open-source and proprietary models.  To use LLMWare, you do not need to use any proprietary LLM - we would encourage you to experiment with [SLIM](https://www.huggingface.co/llmware/), [BLING](https://huggingface.co/llmware), [DRAGON](https://huggingface.co/llmware), [Industry-BERT](https://huggingface.co/llmware), the GGUF examples, along with bringing in your favorite models from HuggingFace and Sentence Transformers. 

If you would like to use a proprietary model, you will need to provide your own API Keys.   API keys and secrets for models, aws, and pinecone can be set up for use in environment variables or passed directly to method calls.

- üí° Private cloud - keeping documents, data pipelines, data stores, and models safe and secure  
- üí° Model quantization, especially GGUF, and democratizing the game-changing use of 1-9B CPU-based LLMs  
- üí° Developing small specialized RAG-optimized LLMs between 1B-9B parameters  
- üí° Industry-specific LLMs, embedding models and processes to support core knowledge-based use cases
